### Why is it important to choose a license?

It is important to choose a license because it decides who can use your product and how it can be used. Even if you intend for your program to be open source, it is still copyrighted by the author until **explicitly** licensed otherwise.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Once a program is written, it is copyrighted by the author. Until a project is explicitly licensed to allow others to use or modify it, you are not legally allowed to use it. Therefore, unless if you'd like to get sued, you **should not** use a project without an explicit license.

### Failure to follow the Open System Model

I agree with the idea that Gopher's approach to Open Systems was executed extremely poorly and ultimately led to their downfall. It makes sense that by letting the open source developers have _less_ control over the central pieces of the project could easily lead to developers being less capable of doing what they need to. In addition, the "pay to host" philosophy used was a big proponent in the downfall of Gopher. Open source developers _should_ be able to freely develop the product, no fees attached. After all, _they are providing free labor._ As we learned during the Git lab, forking should generally be used for creating a standalone project rather than to continue working on the main project, which is why it makes sense that this splintering in the Gopher repository quickly led to a downfall. Developers were quickly leaving the project and did not come back, ultimately arriving at Gopher's demise.

### Why is Linux licensed under GPL v2?

Linux is licensed under GPL v2 because it does not give any one person copyright, but rather it gives each person that has contributed copyright. It does not allow sublicensing (i.e. selling copies), or holding any contributors liable for issues during use, which keeps the contributor pool safe (and by extension healthy). They do not switch over to GPL v3 because a portion of the high-ups in the Linux development (i.e. Linus Torvalds) do not agree with some of the conditions introduced in GPL v3 (such as the anti-tivoization arguments, which block companies from creating hardware restrictions for their software).
